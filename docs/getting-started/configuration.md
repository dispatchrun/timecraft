# Configuring Timecraft

By default, configuration is stored at `~/.timecraft/config.yaml`. This can
be overridden by setting the `TIMECRAFTCONFIG` environment variable. The
Timecraft directory and configuration file are created on demand.

To view the current Timecraft configuration, run:

```console
$ timecraft config
```

To edit the Timecraft configuration with your `$EDITOR`, run:

```console
$ timecraft config --edit
```
